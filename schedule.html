                   She then agrees to be his assistant in order to get closer to him. As they work on his manga, they encounter other schoolmates who assist 
                   them or serve as inspirations for characters in the stories.

        These merciless murderers only leave behind scant remainders of souls called "Torches," which are mere residues that will eventually be destroyed, along with the very fact of the 
        victims' existence from the minds of the living. In an ambitious endeavor to put an end to this invisible, hungry massacre, warriors called Flame Hazes relentlessly fight these monsters.
        </p><p>One fateful day, Yuuji Sakai ceases to be a regular high schooler—he becomes trapped in a crevice of time and is suddenly attacked by a Denizen. Coming to his rescue just in the nick of 
        time is a nameless hunter who seems no different from an ordinary young girl except for her blazing eyes and burning crimson hair. However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his
        situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.</p></div>

        enjoys her carefree life as a third-year high school student and member of the School Living Club. The club, consisting of the president Yuuri Wakasa, the athletic Kurumi Ebisuzawa,
        the mature junior Miki Naoki, the supervising teacher Megumi Sakura, and the club dog Taroumaru, prides itself on making the most of life at school. However, this illusion of
        endless bliss is just a bubble waiting to be burst because Yuki is unable to perceive what is truly happening around her. In reality, all is not as it seems—the real purpose of
        the School Living Club is to escape from the shocking and disturbing truth: the girls are in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and have barricaded themselves inside the school 
        as the sole survivors.</p><p>Based on the manga by Kaihou Norimitsu, Gakkougurashi! follows a group of girls who are forced to adapt to a post-apocalyptic life all by themselves.
        They have no means of contact with the outside world and are surrounded by hostile undead waiting to devour them. The girls must not only contend with the challenge of survival;
        they must also strive to maintain a false appearance of normality in Yuki's presence. </p>

        <div class="titleDescription"><p>The original manga revolves around a girl named Yokoi who sits next to a boy only known as Seki-kun. During class, Seki-kun continues 
        to not pay attention and instead creates amazing little distractions, such as a detailed golf course with the course's hole being a dent in his desk, or an entire 
        dramatic war being played out by paper shogi pieces. Yokoi often finds herself getting reluctantly interested in his games, even though they always seem to end up getting 
        HER in trouble with the teacher!

        <div class="titleDescription"><p>Rescued from a hellish inferno as a child and taught the art of magecraft by Kiritsugu Emiya, Shirou 
        Emiya idolized his adoptive father. After his father's untimely death, Shirou vowed to follow in his footsteps and fight for the good of the world. Years later, Shirou 
        lingers at his school after nightfall and comes across a battle being waged by two superhuman beings known as Servants. When one of these Servants tries to kill him, Shirou 
        ends up summoning a Servant of his own, a knight by the name of Saber. Together, they become the final participants in the fifth Holy Grail War, a free-for-all battle carried
        out by seven Servants and their summoners, with the prize being a magical device that can grant any wish. <p> Based off the famous visual novel by Type-Moon, Fate/Stay Night
        chronicles the trials and challenges that Shirou faces as he enters a battle that he knew nothing about, but that may very well lead him towards the path of becoming a hero
        like his father… if he survives, that is.</p>

        <div class="titleDescription"><p>At the border between heaven and hell lies a bar. There the attendant will, one after another, challenge pairs of the recently deceased to a random
        game in which their fate of either ascending into heaven or falling into hell will be wagered. Whether it's bowling, darts, air hockey, or anything in between, each person's true 
        nature will be revealed in a ghastly parade of death and memories, dancing to the whims of the bar's master. Welcome to Quindecim, where Decim, arbiter of the afterlife, awaits!</p>
        Death Parade expands upon the original one-shot intended to train young animators. It follows yet more people receiving judgement - until a strange, black-haired guest causes Decim
        to begin questioning his own rulings.</p>
